                I'm excited to share my school project a chat app created using Android Studio, Java, and Firebase.
                This
                project has been a valuable learning experience, teaching me how to integrate Firebase for real-time
                messaging, design user interfaces with XML, and enhance my Java programming skills. I'm delighted with
                the
                outcome!</h4>

                <br>
                I developed a webshop using WebStorm and harnessed my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The
                webshop features an attractive and user-friendly interface, offering a range of products with detailed
                descriptions and images. JavaScript is utilized to enable product filtering, dynamic cart management,
                and a smooth checkout process. Shoppers can browse, add items to their cart, and complete purchases with
                ease. The combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript results in a fully functional and engaging webshop.

                <br>
                I've recently developed a website in Dutch with a unique purpose: to offer support and guidance to those
                struggling with adrenaline addiction. It's one of my initial website projects, where I started delving
                into the world of CSS.

                This platform is dedicated to helping individuals break free from the grip of adrenaline addiction. It's
                a reflection of my early web development journey and a testament to my commitment to making a positive
                impact.

                From the early days of learning CSS to crafting a resource that aims to make a difference in people's
                lives, this project signifies my dedication to continuous improvement and the power of technology to
                bring about positive change.

            <h4>DESCRIPTION
                <br>
                <br>


                this period I've worked on c# and game development, my exploration of game development has been both dynamic and collaborative. Proficient in both 2D and 3D realms within Unity, I have successfully crafted a captivating 2D shooter game independently and collaborated on a 3D shooter with a team of four designers and a fellow programmer. This collaborative effort not only honed my technical skills but also emphasized the importance of teamwork in delivering immersive gaming experiences.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the realm of software development, I designed and implemented a ticket-creating program using Visual Studio, showcasing my adept understanding of C#. This experience underscores my ability to translate programming knowledge into practical applications.
                <br>
                <br>
                Furthermore, I've demonstrated my proficiency in animation by creating engaging animations in Unity. I've honed my code structure skills by working with classes in Visual Studio and implementing inheritance in Unity. These aspects have not only enhanced the visual appeal of my projects but also solidified my grasp on fundamental programming principles.
                <br>
                <br>
                My experience in working collaboratively on Unity projects with another developer, utilizing GitHub for version control, exemplifies my adaptability and effectiveness in team settings. This skill ensures streamlined collaboration, efficient project development, and effective version management.
